/* Add CSS Styling */
.avatar.proportioned {
    width: 300px;
    height: auto;
}

.avatar.distorted {
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
}
Make the element with both the `avatar` and `distorted` classes 200 pixels wide, then 
make its height twice as big as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).
